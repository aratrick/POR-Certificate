# POR-Certificate

 I have been serving as the head of Suspension-Brakes-Steering(SBS) Subsystem, Automobile Club, IIT Guwahati. In my tenure, I have learnt many new things and tried to apply the same in the designing of our first FSEV car.
 Along with this, I am also mentoring a group of juniors by teaching them the necessary software and skillsets needed in the club so that they can build upcoming cars in an easy and comfortable way and also make further improvements in the car.
